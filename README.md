# PRODIGY_DS_02
This is my second data science task at Prodigy Infotech as a Data Science intern, involving data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to uncover insights.
It helped me build skills in handling missing values, correcting data types, and visualizing key patterns.
Through this task, I gained a better understanding of data structure and improved my EDA and visualization skills.
